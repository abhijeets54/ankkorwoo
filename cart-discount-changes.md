# Cart Discount Code Changes

## Overview

We've removed the discount code feature from our custom cart implementation and will now rely exclusively on Shopify's native checkout discount code functionality. This change simplifies our codebase and ensures a more consistent experience by using Shopify's built-in discount management system.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed from Cart Component:**
   - Removed the promo code input UI
   - Removed all promo code state variables
   - Removed the discount calculation logic
   - Removed the discount display from the order summary

2. **Added Information:**
   - Added a note informing users that discount codes can be applied at checkout
   - Updated the order summary text to clarify that discounts will be calculated at checkout

3. **Left Untouched:**
   - Checkout redirection process
   - Cart item management
   - Other cart functionality

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Codebase:**
   - Reduced complexity in the cart component
   - Eliminated redundant discount logic

2. **Better Integration with Shopify:**
   - Leverages Shopify's robust discount system
   - Ensures proper tax and discount calculations
   - Accommodates complex discount rules that would be difficult to replicate in our custom cart

3. **Improved User Experience:**
   - Consolidates all payment-related actions to a single step
   - Avoids confusion from having discounts in multiple places
   - Ensures users see the same discount options regardless of checkout path

## Technical Implementation

The implementation is straightforward. We've:

1. Removed the promo code-related state and UI from the Cart component
2. Added informative text to guide users toward using discounts at checkout
3. Ensured the checkout redirection works correctly with Shopify's native discount functionality

## Shopify Checkout Discount Codes

Shopify's checkout allows customers to enter discount codes that you've created in the Shopify admin. These can include:

- Percentage discounts
- Fixed amount discounts
- Free shipping
- Buy X get Y deals
- And other complex discount structures

All discounts are managed in the Shopify admin under Discounts, ensuring they're properly accounted for in your store's financial reporting.

## Future Considerations

If we want to highlight specific promotions, we can:

1. Add a promotional banner at the top of the cart
2. Pre-populate discount codes during checkout by appending them to the checkout URL
3. Create automatic discounts in Shopify that don't require a code to be entered
