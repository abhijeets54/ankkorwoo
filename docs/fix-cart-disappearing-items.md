# Fix for Disappearing Cart Items

This document explains the issue where items get added to the cart but then disappear after 1 second, and how we fixed it.

## Problem

During the migration from Shopify to WooCommerce, users experienced an issue where:

1. Items would be added to the cart successfully
2. After about 1 second, the items would disappear from the cart
3. This happened consistently with all products

## Root Causes

We identified several root causes:

1. **Overly Strict Product Validation**: The cart was automatically removing products that couldn't be found in WooCommerce
2. **Error Handling**: Instead of gracefully handling missing products, errors were thrown causing items to be removed
3. **Persistence Issues**: Zustand's persist middleware wasn't immediately saving to localStorage
4. **ID Mapping**: Product IDs from Shopify weren't properly mapped to WooCommerce IDs

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Stop Automatic Item Removal

We modified the `loadProductHandles` function in `Cart.tsx` to not automatically remove items that can't be found in WooCommerce:

```typescript
// Instead of marking for removal, just use a fallback slug
newHandles[item.productId] = 'product-not-found';

// Log the error for debugging but don't remove the item
if (error.message?.includes('No product ID was found')) {
  console.warn(`Product with ID ${item.productId} not found in WooCommerce, but keeping in cart`);
}
```

### 2. More Lenient Product ID Validation

We updated the `validateProductId` function to always return a valid ID even if it's not found in the mapping:

```typescript
export async function validateProductId(productId: string): Promise<string> {
  // Even if the ID is invalid, return it instead of null
  if (!productId || productId === 'undefined' || productId === 'null') {
    console.warn('Invalid product ID received:', productId);
    return productId; // Return the original ID even if invalid
  }
  
  // Return original ID if no mapping found
  // ...
}
```

### 3. Fallback Products

We updated the `getProductById` function to return a fallback product instead of throwing an error:

```typescript
function createFallbackProduct(id: string) {
  return {
    id: id,
    databaseId: 0,
    name: "Product Not Found",
    slug: "product-not-found",
    description: "This product is no longer available.",
    // ...other fallback properties
  };
}
```

### 4. Immediate localStorage Persistence

We added immediate localStorage persistence to all cart operations to ensure changes are saved immediately:

```typescript
// Immediately persist to localStorage
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  try {
    const state = {
      state: {
        items: updatedItems,
        itemCount: updatedItems.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.quantity, 0),
        isLoading: false,
        error: null
      },
      version: STORAGE_VERSION
    };
    localStorage.setItem('ankkor-local-cart', JSON.stringify(state));
  } catch (storageError) {
    console.warn('Failed to manually persist cart to localStorage:', storageError);
  }
}
```

## How to Test

1. Add a product to your cart
2. Verify that it stays in the cart after page refresh
3. Try adding a product with an invalid ID (if you have one for testing)
4. Verify that it still stays in the cart

## Additional Improvements

1. **User Feedback**: The cart now shows "Product Not Found" for items that no longer exist, allowing users to manually remove them
2. **Error Logging**: Better error logging helps identify problematic products
3. **Resilience**: The cart is now more resilient to API errors and network issues

## Future Enhancements

1. **Product ID Migration Tool**: Develop a more comprehensive tool to map Shopify product IDs to WooCommerce IDs
2. **Automatic Cleanup**: Add a background process to clean up invalid products after a certain period
3. **User Notifications**: Add notifications to inform users when products in their cart are no longer available
